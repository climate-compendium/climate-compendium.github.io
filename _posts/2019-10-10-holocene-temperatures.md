There is a blog post from Jos Hagelaars 
published March 19, 2013 at [ourchangingclimate.wordpress.com](https://ourchangingclimate.wordpress.com/2013/03/19/the-two-epochs-of-marcott/) resuming the work of Marcott et al.
about reconstruction of average temperatures after the ice age through the holocene and including a middle global warming projection until 2100.

The post includes a picture showing those average temperatures from 20.000 years ago until the end of this century.

 Figure from the blog post cited above: "The temperature reconstruction of Shakun et al (green – shifted manually by 0.25 degrees), of Marcott et al (blue), combined with the instrumental period data from HadCRUT4 (red) and the model average of IPCC projections for the A1B scenario up to 2100 (orange)."

Marcott's paper was criticised relating the "hockey stick" pointing upwards in the last 100 years, because this
could not be derived from the used data sources.

This blog post from Roger Pielke, Jr. criticizes this particular part of the curve:
[Fixing the Marcott Mess in Climate Science](http://rogerpielkejr.blogspot.com/2013/03/fixing-marcott-mess-in-climate-science.html)

I cites the related answer from the author:

- Q: What do paleotemperature reconstructions show about the temperature of the last 100 years?

- A: Our global paleotemperature reconstruction includes a so-called “uptick” in temperatures during the 20th-century. However, in the paper we make the   point that this particular feature is of shorter duration than the inherent smoothing in our statistical averaging procedure, and that it is based on    only a few available paleo-reconstructions of the type we used. Thus, the 20th century portion of our paleotemperature stack is not statistically 
  robust, cannot be considered representative of global temperature changes, and therefore is not the basis of any of our conclusions.

So, seems we have to check other sources relating the youngest temperature history...
