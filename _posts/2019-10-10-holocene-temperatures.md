There is a blog post from Jos Hagelaars 
published March 19, 2013 at [ourchangingclimate.wordpress.com](https://ourchangingclimate.wordpress.com/2013/03/19/the-two-epochs-of-marcott/) resuming the work of Marcott et al.
about reconstruction of average temperatures after the ice age through the holocene and including a middle global warming projection until 2100.

The post includes a picture showing those average temperatures from 20.000 years ago until the end of this century.

 Figure from the blog post cited above: "The temperature reconstruction of Shakun et al (green â€“ shifted manually by 0.25 degrees), of Marcott et al (blue), combined with the instrumental period data from HadCRUT4 (red) and the model average of IPCC projections for the A1B scenario up to 2100 (orange)."
