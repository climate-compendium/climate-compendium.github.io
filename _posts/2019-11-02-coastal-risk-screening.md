Because of melting ice and warming ocean water the sea level is rising. There is a map showing which regions
are under threat of coastal flooding until 2050.

The map is showing the [land projected to be below annual flood level in 2050](https://coastal.climatecentral.org).

About 200 - 300 million fo people are living in those areas.

Additionally several big cities build on river deltas like Bangkok, Tokio, Shanghai, Jakarta and others,
are sinking annually at a greater scale then sea level is rising because of global warming.
