Counteraction of global warming occurs on various levels: national and international, organizational, businesses, ... individual.

## International and national level
  
This comprises the international climate conferences
[United Nations climate change conferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:United_Nations_climate_change_conferences), 
supported by [The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)](https://www.ipcc.ch/) and other activities
mainly under the umbrella of United Nations , see
[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change)
at Wikipedia.

## Organizational level

Political movements and NGOs acting on the prevention of global warming includes e.g.

- [Fridays for Future (FFF)](https://www.fridaysforfuture.org/), also known as 
  [School strike for the climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_strike_for_the_climate), initiated by Greta Thunberg
   inluding spread offs like [Scientists for Future](https://www.scientists4future.org/)

- [Extinction Rebellion (XR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_Rebellion)

- [Association for the Taxation of Financial Transactions and for Citizens' Action (ATTAC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_the_Taxation_of_Financial_Transactions_and_for_Citizens%27_Action)

- [Greenpeace](https://www.greenpeace.org)

- [The Green New Deal (GND)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_New_Deal)

- [Vegan organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Vegan_organizations), like [Go Vegan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_Vegan_(political_party)) 

... and many, many others.

## Business level

Many businesses act under the umbrella of [United Nations Global Compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Global_Compact).

## Individual level

Individuals are part of all of the above levels and without their commitment and dedication none of them could succeed. So in fact this is the most important level where people are ready to work together within the frameworks of bigger organizations to counteract global warming.
