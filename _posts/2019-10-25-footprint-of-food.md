BBC provides us with a
[basic carbon footprint calculator for food](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-46459714)
giving additional facts and comparision helping you with decreasing your footprint. 
According to BBC a quarter of global GHG emissions come from food. 58% from animal
products, and the half of it from beef and lamb.

So reducing meat and especially lamb & beef will reduce your foodprint considerably.

There is also a US site by
[Green Eatz](http://www.greeneatz.com/foods-carbon-footprint.html)
giving the following picture showing the footprint of several diets:

So is a vegan diat the best option to minimize our food's GHG emissions? Well there could appear some issues, when
we all would eat vegan completely:

- certain ingredients necesarry in a fully vegan diet for plant-based fats and protein
  like almonds and avocadoes causes environmental or economical problems.
  This is discussed in the article [Vegan vs flexitarian â€“ which will save the planet?](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/articles/vegan_vs_flexitarian)
- another problem is fertilising of grounds. If we use ammonia based fertilisers a lot we cause
  environmental problems, e.g. The Haber-Bosch process for industrial production of ammonia is responsible
  for 3% to 5% of world's GHG emissions. Grass-fed cattle plays an important role in a sustainable
  farming. See the section ["Eat grass-fed meat" in this article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/articles/cut_food_emissions)
