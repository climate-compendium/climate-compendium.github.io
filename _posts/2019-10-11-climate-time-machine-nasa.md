NASA satellites can provide a view on global atmospheric temperatures not only over land but also over sea, which includes
a much larger area then terrestric measuring stations. So let's look there.

They provide a diagram and a map view of 
[Global temperature from 1884 till 2018](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/).

They also provide a 
[Climate Time Machine](https://climate.nasa.gov/interactives/climate-time-machine) where you can
see in addition the evolution of carbon dioxide contained in the atmosphere and the extension of the arctic sea ice.

Well they did not had satellites back in the 19th century and the page does not explain where the sea records come from.
But it includes a link to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
[NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/), which provides an "Old weather time machine" together with
more detailed information here: 

[Old weather “time machine” opens a treasure trove for researchers](https://research.noaa.gov/article/ArtMID/587/ArticleID/2560/Old-weather-%E2%80%9Ctime-machine%E2%80%9D-opens-a-treasure-trove-for-researchers)

This page explains that the sea weather records came from ship's logs.
