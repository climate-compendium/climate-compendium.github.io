The [Climate Action Tracker](https://climateactiontracker.org) is an independent scientific analysis that tracks government climate action and measures it against the globally agreed Paris Agreement aim of "holding warming well below 2°C, and pursuing efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C." 

A collaboration of two organisations, Climate Analytics and New Climate Institute, the CAT has been providing this independent analysis to policymakers since 2009.

[The Climate Action Tracker](https://climateactiontracker.org) provides a map where emission history, current status and
a projection based on current policies are shown for various countries.
