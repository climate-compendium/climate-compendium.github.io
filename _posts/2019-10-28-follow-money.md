Economy is driven by money. So in order to counteract global warming, 
institutions began to withdraw theire money from carbon based industry and invest in values
which does not rely on GHG emissions.

Initiatives which work together with cities and various institutions involve:
- [350.org](https://350.org/)
- [Fossil Free](https://gofossilfree.org)
- [Germanwatch e.V.](https://germanwatch.org)
- [urgewald e.V.](https://urgewald.org/)   

and others.

There is a [list of institutions that committed to Fossil Free](https://gofossilfree.org/divestment/commitments/), 
and a [ranking of the top 100 coal reserve  and top 100 oil&gas reserve owners](http://fossilfreeindexes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CU200_Final_29-Oct-2015.pdf).

The [top 10 of each](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QgU9VN23JaNh2B0pb9eoHM5EMozsznaojpIulQuljDg)
are also available as a spreadsheet.
