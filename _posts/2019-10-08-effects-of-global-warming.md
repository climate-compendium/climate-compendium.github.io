There is an overwelming number of articles flying around climate change now, but how to get to the facts about it's effects.
Well, Wikipedia is often a good starting point.

When I started this year to read more about climate change, I just used Google news and Google search in the beginning. But this way you
get various topics, not tightly related to each ohter, and more or less by accident. So where to start when you want to understand the issue in more depth.
At some point I began to read about the facts in good old Wikipedia. But also there I was rapidly lost between the numerous articles and did not 
manage to keep the overview and not miss anything important.

But that is, what categories are made for. So finally I got to this page about the effects of global warming
which links to all the pages related to just this topic:

[Wikipedia: Effects of global warming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Effects_of_global_warming)

Some more categories serving as a table of content for pages relating climate change I
listed here:

[Wikipedia category pages on climate change](/topics/wikipedia-climate-categories.html)

Hope this would be helpful also to the interested reader.
