Green house gas emissions can be considered as a debt accumulated over time. The site [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/)
 provides a view, showing which countries have contributed how much so far.

There are several approaches to calculate the emmissions of a country or world region. The diagram below
is calculated production based, i.e. considering domestic fuel combustion and cement production.
There are [other views on the same page](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions)
considering also trade and consumption. Land use aspects like planting and harvesting of trees seems not to be considered.

There is also an [interactive map](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cumulative-co-emissions)
showing the accumulated emissions by country over time.

Using "+ Add Country" you may even directly compare the curves of several countries, like in the following picture.
