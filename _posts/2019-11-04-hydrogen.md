Not using fossil fuels as primary power source anymore, but electric power from solar panels and wind turbines instead,
requires a secondary technology to store electric energy.

Electric energy needs to be stored during peak production for later use when the demand is higher than the 
generated power, for driving cars etc. Beside batteries which are quite limited in availability and reach, 
[hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Hydrogen_economy) could be used as a secondary power source.

Looking on the whole chain of generation, storage, transport and use, hydrogen is less efficient (35% - 40%) than lithium-ion batteries (65% - 70%),
able to store electric power directly. But exploitable sources of lithium are very limited as is the reach of batteries. So hydrogen could complement where higher capacity and reach are required.

Currently there are several technologies under development competing for the best outcome:

1. For [production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_economy#Methods_of_production) from electric power, e.g.:
    - [Electrolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis_of_water)
    - [Kv√¶rner process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kv%C3%A6rner_process)
    - a variation called [Plasma gasification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_gasification)

2. For [storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_economy#Storage) and transport:
    - [Pressurized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_economy#Pressurized_hydrogen_gas)
    - [Liquid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_economy#Liquid_hydrogen)
    - [Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_storage#Liquid_organic_hydrogen_carriers_(LOHC))
    - and [others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_storage)

3. For use:
    - [Fuel cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell)
    - replacing natural gas directly, e.g. in [hydrogen-fueled turbines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusina_hydrogen_power_station)
