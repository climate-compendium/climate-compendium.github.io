We have to stop combustion of fossil fuels as soon as possible. But as this appeareantly takes some
time to implement, people seek ways to remove carbondioxide from the atmosphere, e.g. by growing more trees.

We need some transitional time to reshape our economy, technology a.s.o., so we use carbon from the natural carbon cycle exclusively.
So people consider several solutions for removal and sequestration of superfluous  carbondioxide
from the carbon cycle. One of the considered solutions is growing more trees.

There were various more or less optimistic estimations how much we could remove. 
Recently (18ths of Oct '19), a 
[Comment on “The global tree restoration potential”](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6463/eaay7976/tab-pdf)
was published in Science, which tried to correct too optimistic estimations and came to the conclusion,
that growing trees on all available areas not used otherwise would allow to remove a maximum of 42 GtC in total.

The papaer assumes a total historical anthropogenic emissions of 660 GtC with yearly addition of 10 GtC.
So growing trees could potentially remove 6% of the carbondioxide accumulated in the atmosphere so far. 
But we had to do it immediately as trees need time to grow and emissions are ongoing. 
The average cost for removing carbondioxide by planting trees varies around 30$ per ton at the moment.
