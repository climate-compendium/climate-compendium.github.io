Greenhouse gas emissions are measured by tons of carbon (tC) or
tons of CO₂ equivalent (tCO₂e). Yearly emissions of GHG yields currently more then 
36 GtCO₂e (giga tons of CO₂ equivalents)

|  | GtC | GtCO₂e [^1]| 
|:---|---:|---:|
| factor | 1 | 3.65 | 
| world emission from fossil fuels & industry 2017 | 10 | 36.5 |  
| accumulated emission from fossil fuels & industry | 425 | 1550 |  
| accumulated emission from land use | 180 | 660 |  
|---+---|
| part accumulated in the atmosphere | 250 | 910 |  
| part accumulated in the ocean | 150 | 550  |  
| part accumulated in biosphere, pedosphere, geosphere | 200 | 730 |  

| source | share (2017) [^1] |
|:---|---:|
| coal | 40% |
| oil | 35% |
| gas | 20% |
| cement | 4% |
| flaring | 1% |

| MwH | tCO₂ [^2]|
|:---|---:|
| gas turbine | 0.5 |
| oil | 0.65 |
| coal	| 0.9 |
| saved by carbon free source | 0.28 |
