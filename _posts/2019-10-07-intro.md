I introduce my new blog collecting facts and figures about climate change and ongoing activities to mitigate global warming.

Honestly I did not pay much attention to the global warming topic during the last 30 years
until the last summers got remarkably hotter and Greta Thunberg started her weekly school strike for climate.

So also thanks to her I started to read about the climate change and found out only lately how serious it is. 
On the other hand it was not that easy to collect the hard facts. There are a lot of articles in the news,
presenting opinions of various journalists, but I want the real facts.

So I'm starting this blog site now, to share the interesting web pages I found so far and those 
I will find helpful in the future. Hope thus it will get a bit easier for you to get down to the facts.

Also I want to show what people do in various regions to counterfight the green house gas emmissions
collecting in the atmosphere and all the changes related to it. So in case you want to join those activities you may
 find your place easier within the team.

Kind regards,
  Siegfried.
