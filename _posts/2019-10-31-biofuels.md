Biofuels are produced from biomass thus avoiding the use of fossil fuels. So they are COâ‚‚ neutral 
as their emissions are derived from the natural carbon cycle.

They are made from various plants like grass:

- [Corn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_ethanol)
- [Sugar cane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugarcane)
- [Miscanthus giganteus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscanthus_giganteus#GHG_savings)

but also others like

- [Eucalyptus trees](https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/jet-fuel-turned-green/index.html)
- [Jatropha (a spurge)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jatropha_curcas#Biodiesel) 
  (used for [jet fuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jatropha_curcas#Jet_fuel))
- [Fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofuel#Fungi)
- [Algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algae_fuel)
- [Bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofuel#Animal_gut_bacteria)

Fuel types are e.g.
- [Biogas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogas)
- [Syngas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasification)
- [Ethanol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol_fuel)
- [Other bioalcohols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofuel#Other_bioalcohols)
- [Biodiesel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiesel)
- [Green diesel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable_oil_refining)
- [Vegetable oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable_oil_fuel)
- [Bioethers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofuel#Bioethers)

The big disadvantage of biofuels is that they compete with food production consuming land, water and fertilizers.
Especially eucalyptus or Jatropha require a lot of water for growing.
