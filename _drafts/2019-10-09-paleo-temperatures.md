On Youtube you can find several people denying that global warming is an issue, as there were already times in the past with comparable 
average temparture and warming phases. I found a picture at Wikimedia Commons showing earth's temparture curve from 500 milion years back till today.

Trying to get an idea what increasing temperatures could mean and if this is a normal event in earth's history finally, I found this
picture showing the temperature curve for 500 million years. Wow!

Ok, what we could learn from this picture:
- there were considerably higher temperatures on our planet some millions of years back, but long before humankind were born;
  and we shouldn't forget that five periods of mass extinction took place during those times.
- last time we had such temperatures as we expect now for the end of this century, we had before the ice age
- some of our predecessors aleady lived on earth at that time, but: they were not so many, so did not had the 
  issue to give enough food to some billion of their people and 
- that time the warming took a lot longer, it was maybe 10 times slower than theses days, so nature had a lot more time to adapt to higher temperature

So I think, if we want to avoid a catastrophic situation with billions of people unable to get enough food, maybe even water, millions of people 
forced to abandon theire homes and starting to migrate seeking for a better place to live a.s.o we have to find a way to break this vicious circle,
we started some hundred years ago burning coal, mineral oil and gas so much.

The circle must be broken, as the Ood sayd in Doctor Who.
